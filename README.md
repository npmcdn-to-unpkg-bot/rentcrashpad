What?
====
A simple website with a directory of climbers that could rent you a crashpad when you're travelling.

Why?
====
Travelling with crashpads in budget rental cars is something you'd try to avoid whenever possible. At the same time many climbers around the world have gathered quite a collection of crashpads over the years. Why not rent them out and make some extra cash?
